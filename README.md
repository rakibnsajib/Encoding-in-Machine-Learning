## Encoding in Machine Learning

### Introduction
Encoding is the process of converting data from one form to another. In machine learning, we encode categorical data into numerical data so that the machine learning model can understand and learn from it. In this article, we will discuss the different types of encoding techniques and when to use them.

### Types of Encoding
There are three types of encoding techniques:
1. Nominal Encoding
2. One-Hot Encoding
3. Ordinal Encoding
